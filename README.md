# 🧹 Task 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – AI/ML Internship

## 📁 Dataset
**Marvel Characters Dataset** (uploaded manually)

---

## 🎯 Objective
To learn and apply data cleaning and preprocessing techniques essential for Machine Learning pipelines.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📌 Steps Followed

### 1. Import & Explore Data
- Loaded dataset using `pandas`
- Checked data types, shape, and missing values

### 2. Handle Missing Values
- Numerical columns: filled with **mean**
- Categorical columns: filled with **mode**

### 3. Encode Categorical Features
- Used `LabelEncoder` to convert categorical text data into numerical values

### 4. Normalize Features
- Applied `StandardScaler` to scale numerical features for better model performance

### 5. Outlier Detection & Removal
- Visualized using **boxplots**
- Removed outliers using **Z-score method**

---

## 📊 Insights
- Preprocessing reduced noise and ensured all features were numeric and standardized.
- This step is crucial before feeding data into machine learning models to improve accuracy and efficiency.

---

## 🔍 What I Learned
- Real-world datasets often contain missing values and noise
- Proper encoding and scaling are essential
- Outlier removal can drastically improve model performance
- Hands-on experience with tools like pandas, sklearn, seaborn
